* About Me

Hey there! I'm *bytenoob*, a software engineer based in China with a passion for building decentralized systems and exploring the frontiers of blockchain technology.

** What I Do

I work at the intersection of distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain technology. My focus areas include:

- **Blockchain & Decentralized Systems**: Building infrastructure for the decentralized web
- **Network Programming**: Creating efficient networking protocols and encrypted communication systems
- **Systems Programming**: Working with Go, Rust, and C++ to build performant, reliable software
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and maintaining several open-source projects

** Notable Projects

*** What I Build
Beyond open source contributions, I work on several proprietary projects focusing on:

- **Advanced MEV Infrastructure**: Developing high-performance MEV bots in Rust that implement sophisticated strategies including:
  - Sandwich attack detection and execution with optimal parameter calculation
  - Multi-DEX arbitrage across Uniswap V2-style AMMs
  - Real-time mempool monitoring with WebSocket-based transaction analysis
  - Flashbots bundle creation and private transaction submission
  - Integration with novel blockchain protocols for unique MEV opportunities

- **Cross-chain Relay Systems**: Building infrastructure for seamless blockchain interoperability:
  - Custom transaction encoding for protocol-specific chains
  - Multi-provider architecture for concurrent chain monitoring
  - Balance-aware transaction optimization
  - Dynamic fee calculation across heterogeneous networks

- **Protocol-Specific Optimizations**: Creating specialized systems that leverage unique blockchain features:
  - Custom mining mechanisms based on gas consumption patterns
  - Integration with novel token issuance models
  - Cost-benefit analysis with real-time price feed integration

*** Open Source Contributions
- **[[https://github.com/nknorg/nkn][NKN (New Kind of Network)]]**: Core contributor to the official Go implementation of NKN full node
- **[[https://github.com/nknorg/encrypted-stream][Encrypted Stream]]**: Golang library for building encrypted streaming connections
- **[[https://github.com/nknorg/tuna][TUNA]]**: Marketplace for services leveraging NKN's decentralized network

** Technical Stack

My primary languages and tools:
- **Languages**: Go (primary), Rust, C++, Emacs Lisp
- **Interests**: Distributed systems, cryptography, blockchain protocols, network programming
- **Editor**: Emacs (of course!)

** Philosophy

I believe in the power of decentralized systems to create a more open and resilient internet. Through my work on blockchain infrastructure and encrypted communication protocols, I'm helping build the foundation for a truly peer-to-peer digital future.
